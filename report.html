                <h2>Background: Tuition Payment and Visa Process</h2>
                <p>Por, enrolled in TMU’s Master of Digital Media (MDM) program, initially planned to begin his studies in January 2024. However, due to visa processing delays, he deferred his start date to September 2024. Beginning in November 2023, Por paid over $27,000 in tuition fees early in order to secure his visa. This advance payment served as proof of funds for his application.</p>
                <p>In September 2024, Por discovered that TMU had mistakenly charged him $223 for UHIP, which is mandatory health coverage for international students in Canada. Despite not being in Canada during the January term, he was billed for this fee. Upon realizing the error, Por requested a refund from the university, but TMU refused, stating that too much time had passed since the charge was applied.</p>
                <p>As a result, Por’s tuition for his third semester was short by $223. He intentionally chose not to pay this shortfall, believing that TMU should rectify the mistake and refund the UHIP fee. His refusal to cover the difference ultimately led to his expulsion.</p>

                <h2>Por's Legal Action</h2>
                <p>Por’s lawsuit against TMU contends that the university’s refusal to refund the $223 UHIP fee directly contributed to his expulsion. He maintains that he should not be responsible for a fee applied while he was still outside of Canada and that TMU’s unwillingness to address the issue has placed an unfair financial burden on him. His legal action challenges TMU’s administrative rigidity and highlights the difficulties faced by international students navigating complex systems of fees and documentation.</p>

                <h2>Legal Commentary on Por's Actions</h2>
                <p>From a legal standpoint, Por’s decision to withhold payment for the UHIP fee raises important questions about contractual obligations and the university's duty of care towards its students. According to legal expert Sarah Johnson, "Por's case hinges on whether the university can be held accountable for its administrative errors. If it can be demonstrated that TMU incorrectly billed him while he was not in Canada, he may have a strong argument for breach of contract or unjust enrichment."</p>
                <p>Johnson notes that while Por's actions may seem deliberate, his intention to seek resolution rather than simply defaulting on payment could work in his favor. "The fact that he attempted to rectify the situation by requesting a refund shows he was acting in good faith," she adds. "This could mitigate any claims against him for non-payment."</p>
                <p>Regarding the probability of success in Por's lawsuit, Johnson believes it is contingent upon several factors. "If Por can provide clear evidence of the university's billing error and demonstrate that it directly led to his expulsion, he stands a reasonable chance of winning the case." However, she also cautions that universities often have robust legal defenses in place. "While I would estimate his chances of success to be around 50-60%, the outcome will largely depend on the evidence presented and the university's response to the claims."</p>

                <h2>Public Response: Widespread Disappointment</h2>
                <p>The case has sparked a wave of criticism from various sectors of the public, with many expressing frustration at TMU’s handling of the situation. Rachel Li, a spokesperson for an international student advocacy group, stated, “This is yet another example of how universities are failing to support international students. TMU’s refusal to refund a clearly mistaken charge shows a lack of empathy and accountability. It’s disheartening to see such rigid bureaucracy trump student welfare.”</p>
                <p>John Peterson, a university policy expert, commented, “International students bring significant revenue to Canadian universities, but cases like this raise serious concerns about how institutions treat these students once they are enrolled. There needs to be a reevaluation of how universities handle disputes like these to avoid damaging their reputation further.”</p>

                <h2>Recommendations for TMU: Taking Action</h2>
                <p>In light of the growing public outcry and legal action, TMU must take proactive steps to restore trust and improve its handling of international student issues. The university should:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Implement clearer refund policies.</li>
                    <li>Provide stronger support for international students.</li>
                    <li>Increase transparency and accountability.</li>
                    <li>Engage with the community.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>As Por’s lawsuit unfolds, it will serve as a critical test of TMU’s accountability to its international students and could set a precedent for how similar cases are handled in the future. With public interest and legal scrutiny on his side, Por's fight may not only affect his academic future but also prompt broader discussions about student rights and university policies.</p>
